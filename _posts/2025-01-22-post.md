For the first time since I began my PhD in computer vision, I have completed a research paper entirely on my own and am preparing to submit it. No co-leading, no inherited drafts, no “just implement this part” — every idea, experiment, failure, and revision in this paper carries my full signature. That realization is both empowering and unsettling.

The past months were filled with familiar emotions: frustration when models refused to converge, doubt when results looked ordinary, and long nights questioning whether the contribution was “enough.” Computer vision can be unforgiving; small implementation details can erase weeks of work, and progress often feels invisible until the very end.

Yet today, those struggles feel strangely worthwhile. The paper may not be perfect, but it represents a genuine step from being a student who follows, to a researcher who leads. I learned how to trust my own judgment, how to defend design choices, and how to accept uncertainty without freezing.

Submitting this paper does not feel like an ending. It feels like a quiet beginning — proof that I can turn curiosity into something tangible. No matter the outcome of the review, this moment will remain a personal milestone: the first time I truly felt like a researcher.
