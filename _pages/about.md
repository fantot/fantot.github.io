I am a Phd student at the PCALab of Chongqing University of Science and Technology, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. Bin Fang and co-advised by Prof. Yong Li.

Prior to joining NJUST, I obtained my M.S degree in 2013 from Chongqing University, advised by Prof. Bin Fang and YuanYan Tang, and B.S degree in SouthWest Normal University, 2007. 

Research
======
My research is focused on computer vision and image processing. I’m particularly interested in image restoration (e.g., real-world video dehazing), pedestrian trajectory prediction and urban city governance. My goal is to produce representative and impactful results in these areas.
