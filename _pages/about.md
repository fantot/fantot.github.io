I am a Phd student at the PCALab of Nanjing University of Science and Technology, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jian Yang and co-advised by Prof. Jun Li.

Prior to joining NJUST, I obtained my M.S degree in 2019 from Wenzhou University, advised by Prof. Zhengzhou Tang.

Research
======
My research is focused on computer vision and image processing. I’m particularly interested in image restoration (e.g., real-world dehazing and depth estimation). Representative papers are highlighted.
